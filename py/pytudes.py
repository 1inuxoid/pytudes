# pytudes

"An *Ã©tude* (a French word meaning *study*) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)

This project contains **pytudes**&mdash;Python programs, usually short, for perfecting particular programming skills.

Some programs are in Jupyter (`.ipynb`) notebooks, some in `.py` files. For each notebook you can:
- Click on [co](https://colab.research.google.com) to **run** the file on Colab
- Click on [dn](https://deepnote.com) to **run** the notebook on DeepNote
- Click on [my](https://mybinder.org) to **run** the notebook on MyBinder
- Click on [nb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to **view** the notebook on NBViewer
- Click on the title to **view** the notebook on github.
- Hover over the title to **view** a description.

# Etudes for Programmers

I got the idea for the *"etudes"* part of the name from
this [1978 book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Etudes_for_programmers.html?id=u89WAAAAMAAJ)
by [Charles Wetherell](http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/08/25/interview-with-charles-wetherell)
that was very influential to me when I was first learning to program. I still have my copy.
