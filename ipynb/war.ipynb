    "- **Abstract**: What really matters is not the exact identity of every card in the deck, but rather whether **A**'s next card is higher, lower, or the same as **B**'s next card. For example, if there are only two cards remaining and we know they have different ranks, then the probability of **A** winning is 1/2; it doesn't matter whether the cards are [10, 8] or [2, 5] or any other combination of two distinct ranks.\n",
